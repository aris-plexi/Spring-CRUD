# Spring CRUD

Using Spring MVC/Data, I perform CRUD operations with a basic HTML page as View.

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure to create the necessary table using the files in *~/Trainers_Table* <br>
Credentials used in DB can be found within application.properties file.
Then, proceed to run the app with your preferred IDE:

- In the starting path "/" the User is redirected to "/createtrainer", where you can create a new Trainer.

- Alternatively, the User may click below to navigate to "/readtrainers", where all the Trainers are visible.

- Finally every row of the table can be Updated/Deleted on the spot.
